      <h2>Why View Transitions Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional multi-page websites reload the entire document on every navigation.
        The browser tears down the current page, shows a blank white screen for a brief
        moment, then paints the new page from scratch. On dark-themed sites this creates
        an obvious and jarring white flash.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "The best interface is one where the user never notices the technology —
        they just feel the flow."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The View Transition API solves this by letting the browser capture a screenshot
        of the old page, then crossfade or morph it into the new page. The result feels
        like a native app — smooth, continuous, and without any blank frames.
      </p>

      <h2>The Problem You Just Saw</h2>
      <p>
        Did you notice the white blink when you navigated from the Gallery to this page?
        That flash is the browser's default white background showing through while the
        new document loads. Go back to the Gallery — you'll see it again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now try the "With Transitions" version from the home page to see the same
        two pages without any blink at all.
